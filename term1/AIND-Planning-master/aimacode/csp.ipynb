    "CSPs are a special kind of search problems. Here we don't treat the space as a black box but the state has a particular form and we use that to our advantage to tweak our algorithms to be more suited to the problems. A CSP State is defined by a set of variables which can take values from corresponding domains. These variables can take only certain values in their domains to satisfy the constraints. A set of assignments which satisfies all constraints passes the goal test. Let us start by exploring the CSP class which we will use to model our CSPs. You can keep the popup open and read the main page to get a better idea of the code.\n"

Neighbor is a dict of variables that essentially describes the constraint graph. Here each variable key has a list its value which are the variables that are constraint along with it. The constraint parameter should be a function **f(A, a, B, b**) that **returns true** if neighbors A, B **satisfy the constraint** when they have values **A=a, B=b**. We have additional parameters like nassings which is incremented each time an assignment is made when calling the assign method. You can read more about the methods and parameters in the class doc string. We will talk more about them as we encounter their use. Let us jump to an example."

    "We use the graph coloring problem as our running example for demonstrating the different algorithms in the **csp module**. The idea of map coloring problem is that the adjacent nodes (those connected by edges) should not have the same color throughout the graph. The graph can be colored using a fixed number of colors. Here each node is a variable and the values are the colors that can be assigned to them. Given that the domain will be the same for all our nodes we use a custom dict defined by the **UniversalDict** class. The **UniversalDict** Class takes in a parameter which it returns as value for all the keys of the dict. It is very similar to **defaultdict** in Python except that it does not support item assignment."
