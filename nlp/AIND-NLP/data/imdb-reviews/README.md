# IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset

This dataset is very popular among researchers in Natural Language Processing, usually referred to as the [IMDb 
dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). It consists of movie reviews from the website [imdb.com](http://www.imdb.com/), each 
labeled as either '**pos**itive', if the reviewer enjoyed the film, or '**neg**ative' otherwise.
