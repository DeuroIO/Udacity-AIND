# Project: Bookworm

A simple question-answering system built using IBM Watson's NLP services.

## Overview

In this project, you will use IBM Watson's NLP Services to create a simple question-answering system. You will first use the Discovery service to pre-process a document collection and extract relevant information. Then you will use the Conversation service to build a natural language interface that can respond to questions.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local computer.

If you have the AIND Anaconda environment prepared, now is a good time to activate it.

Open the notebook `bookworm.ipynb` from a terminal using the following command:

```
jupyter notebook bookworm.ipynb
```

Then follow the instructions in the notebook.

**Note**: You may have to install some packages (mentioned in the notebook). To do so, simply open another terminal and use pip.

## Tasks

Complete each task in the notebook by implementing or modifying code wherever there is a `TODO` comment in a code cell, and answering any inline questions by modifying markdown cells. E.g.:

> **Q**: What is the overall sentiment detected in this text? Mention the type (positive/negative) and score.
>
> **A**: Negative, -0.798

Once you have completed all tasks, save the notebook, and then export it into a PDF or HTML. Remember to submit both the notebook  (.ipynb) and the PDF/HTML, along with any other files that may be needed, e.g. data files, in case you use your own (sample files provided with the project don't need to be submitted).

**Note**: Please do not submit your `service-credentials.json` file - that is meant to be kept secret.

## Extensions

Feel free to work on the project with your own dataset. You can also turn it into a web-based application and deploy it on Bluemix.
